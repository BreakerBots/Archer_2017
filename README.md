**Master Branch for the 2017 Archer Repository**

	This is a STABLE branch, and should not be broken in any instant.

-RobotMain
	Chadwick.cpp - Main Robot source file.

-include
	Header files for subsystems of the robot.

-src
	Implementation of classes in include.


**Instructions**
To run the code for Archer_2017, do the following:


1. Create a new C++ Iterative Robot in Eclipse.
2. Clone the Archer_2017 repository into a folder that is not in one's Eclipse workspace.
3. Add Archer_2017/include as an include directory for the project.
4. Link to Archer_2017/src
5. Include Archer_2017/[RobotProgram]
6. Link to Archer_2017/[RobotProgram]

In steps 5+6, Archer_2017/[RobotProgram] is the directory containing the main
robot file for the program (i.e. Archer_2017/Chadwick or Archer_2017/ShooterDemo).
